# 1\. The applications of the Microscope in the investigation of Meteorites.

The mineralogical investigation of a meteoric stone presents difficulties very similar to those which have hitherto rendered the analyses and descriptions of many of the finer-grained terrestrial rocks unsatisfactory; for a meteoric stone is in fact a fragment of a rock, though formed under conditions in some respects widely differing from those which have produced the rocks of our globe.

The difficulties alluded to arise from the minute size and imperfectly developed crystallisation of the mineral constituents alike of the rock and the aërolite; and they have in general baffled the efforts of the chemist on the one hand to effect their separate analyses, and of the crystallographer on the other hand to determine the forms of these constituents. The chemist indeed has endeavoured to overcome the difficulty by attempting a chemical separation of the constituent minerals of these fine-grained mixtures into one group of such as are soluble and another group of those which are insoluble in acids, and then treating the numbers obtained from the analyses of these groups by the light of theoretical considerations founded on the formulæ and properties of known minerals. This method is necessarily only an approximative one. Even granting that by its means we could divide a rock into two classes of ingredients, which we cannot in fact accurately do, there remains the question of how to separate from each other the mingled minerals in, for instance, its insoluble portion.

But the great interest that attaches to whatever may throw light on the history of aërolitic rocks seemed to render it very desirable that some more reliable method should be sought for their investigation. With this end in view, and also with the purpose of basing on such an investigation a scientific classification of the now very extensive collection of aërolites in the British Museum, I some six years ago commenced a systematic examination of these bodies by the microscope. While the meteorites were being cut in order to show their polished surfaces, a small fragment of the portion detached was fastened by its flat side to a strip of glass and carefully worked down to the utmost tenuity. The transparent section thus formed was then examined in the microscope. The results to be obtained by the study of such sections may be divided into such as are structural, throwing light on the physical conditions under which the meteorite was formed, and such as are mineralogical and concern purely the particular minerals that are the ingredients of the stone. From the former class, we learn that a meteorite has had a history; that it has undergone change subsequently to its first consolidation in its present form. The crystalline character of all the constituent minerals; the fissures at one time formed, then filled and then, in many cases, broken across and 'heaved' and filled again, like some mineral lode; the 'chondritic' structure that G. Rose has illustrated*; the fracture, in at least one meteorite, of the spherular 'chondra,' which have been split and severed and recemented into a compact mass, --- these are among the many facts imprinted on a meteorite which are so many records belonging to its history, and which by the aid of the microscope we may read and interpret. But to found a classification on the structural characters of meteorites is not the same thing as to arrange them according to their mineralogical composition. The two must be combined for a philosophical arrangement.

I propose dealing with the mineralogical side of the problem in the present memoir, and to recur hereafter to the structural composition of meteorites, when the nature of their ingredient minerals shall have been rendered clear.

The general features of the microscopic sections of certain meteorites were described by me in the years 1863-64; and the examination in this way has been extended to above 140 distinct aërolites. The crystallography, however, of the numerous crystals seen in such a microscopic section is almost hopelessly difficult. In cases where crystallographic directions are indicated by cleavage-planes or by the 'traces' on the section of determinable crystal faces, some conclusion as to the symmetry and system of the crystal can be drawn from the directions of its optical principal sections as indicated by light polarised in a known plane. And occasionally a section is met with so nearly parallel to one of the important faces of the crystal as to allow some reliance to be placed on the angles of its bounding planes as measured bya delicate eyepiece goniometer. A long series of measurements and determinations of the directions parallel to the principal sections in the crystals met with in these microscopic slides has convinced me that, however useful the microscope may be in revealing the structure of a meteorite and helping to determine its place in a collection of such bodies classified according to their physical constitution, it is only partially of use in determining the mineralogical character of the constituents. But if the applications of polarised light and the eyepiece goniometer are thus limited, the microscope has another function to perform in such an investigation; for, from the carefully bruised débris of particular meteorites selected for the frequent recurrence in them of recognisable minerals, and for the magnitude of the grains of these, one is able to pick out under the microscope the distinct particles of each such mineral.

Such particles occasionally offer cleavage-planes, or even @ crystal face or two, to the goniometer. In a very few cases crystals have been found sufficiently complete to lead to a reliable crystallographic result}. The chief advantage of this method is, however, that it affords the means of analysing the separate minerals selected by it; but even thus the difficulties are considerable. The quantity of material at one's disposal amounts generally to a very few grains, and of these but a small proportion consists of the desired mineral; in fact half a gramme is as much as one is generally able to obtain in a state of purity.

*) The crystals of Anorthite in the Juvinas Meteorite were thus measured in the British Museum by my late colleague, Professor V. von Lang, Sitzungsber. Akad. der Wissensch. Wien, 1867.

The analysis of so small an amount of a silicate is a difficult problem. To break up the silicate by fusion with alkalies implies the introduction of foreign and non-volatile ingredients; to estimate the silica by its loss on treating the mineral by ammonium or hydrogen fluoride were to lose what, in the analysis of such small quantities, is the necessary check afforded by the summing of the percentages of its constituents.

To distil the silica in the form of silicium fluoride, and then to determine it either as silica or as potassium fluosilicate, suggested itself as a means by which this check might be secured. A long series of experiments, undertaken in order to ascertain the best process for thus determining the silica, has resulted in a completely successful application of the method; and by it so small an amount as two-tenths of a gramme of enstatite or of augite has been analysed with a satisfactory result in the Laboratory at the British Museum.

# 2\. On a new Method of analysing Silicates that do not gelatinise with Acids.

The method adopted for the analysis of silicates in small quantity, to which reference has already been made, was the following.

Hydrogen fluoride formed from picked fluor-spar was conducted into water. When the saturation had reached the point at which the liquid gave off fumes, the acid solution was treated in a platinum dish with potassium fluoride so long as any precipitate was formed. After decantation the acid was distilled, the first and last portions being omitted, and the distilled acid preserved in a platinum bottle. A leaden bottle, even when lined with pure gutta percha deposited from its solution in benzole, appears to be attacked by the acid.

A small platinum retort of a capacity of 30 cub. centims. (fig. 1) has fitted into it a tubulated stopper (fig. 2) reaching nearly to the bottom of the retort; a small tube (_b_) enters the straight tube (_k_) of the stopper (_a_) at an angle above the neck of the retort, for the delivery of hydrogen. The straight tube can be stopped either by a small platinum stopper (fig. 3), or by a funnel of that metal (fig. 4) with a stopper (_f_) at the top and a fine orifice at its lower extremity (_h_).

In the side of the retort just below the neck a straight delivery-tube is fixed, which again fits into another platinum tube (fig. 5) that, after taking a curve into a vertical position, is enlarged into a long cylinder capable of passing nearly to the bottom of a test-tube. The test-tube, into which it is fitted by a cork, holds when properly charged 7.5 cub. centims. = 6.6 grammes of a strong solution of ammonia (of specific gravity = 0.88), corresponding to 2.03 of H₃N, and a glass delivery-tube passes to the bottom of another test-tube, also containing a little of that alkali.

The mineral to be analysed is first powdered extremely carefully in an agate mortar; of this a quantity, that may be from 0.2 to 0.5 gramme, is introduced into the retort together with a small platinum ball. The tubulated stopper (fig. 2) is now introduced into its place and cemented by the aid of a little gutta-percha varnish, and by winding over its edge and that of the retort a strip of thin sheet india-rubber. The funnel, with its top closed, is now put into the tubulure of the stopper and filled with the hydrogen fluoride, which has a strength of about 32 per cent. of acid: it contains 1.12 grm. of pure hydrogen fluoride, capable of rendering gaseous 0.84 grm. of silicic acid (SiO₂), and of neutralising 0.95 of ammonia (H₃N). The acid is next admitted to the silicate, and the funnel removed to give place to the small stopper, which, and the joint of the platinum dclivery-tubes, are now sealed with gutta-percha varnish. The apparatus, as prepared for use, is represented in fig. 6.* Pure dry hydrogen is next allowed slowly to traverse the whole apparatus, and the retort is placed in a water-bath at 100° C. for two hours, and occasionally shaken to set the ball in motion. During this operation only a minute trace of silicium difluoride comes over.

*) The scale of figs. 1 to 5 is one-half the actual size of the apparatus; that of fig. 6 is one-third the actual size.

The retort is next transferred to a bath of paraffin and carefully heated in it. At first hydrogen fluoride comes over; and at this point of the process the flow of the hydrogen requires a little attention. At about 132° C., with the silicates described in this memoir, the silica first becomes visible in fine flocks in the ammonia solution, and in another minute the whole is cloudy. In from five to ten minutes the temperature has risen to 142°-145°, and so much of the fluoride has come over that the contents of the tube are of a semi-solid consistency, and nearly the whole of it has in fact passed over. The temperature is allowed to increase to 150°, and the retort then permitted to cool. The process is repeated by introducing a fresh charge of hydrogen fluoride into the retort and of ammonia into the test-tube, and again heating in the paraffin bath. If the quantity of the silicate taken be not more than 0.2 grm., twice charging the retort is sufficient; if it amount to 0.5, three or four repetitions of the process are required. The process must in fact be repeated so long as any fresh flocks of silica can be seen to form in the ammonia tube. Finally, 0.75 cub. centim. of sulphuric acid are introduced into the retort, and the temperature raised to 160°, the stream of hydrogen being continued as before.*

*) In a series of analyses made with a view to determine the degree of energy with which the acid attacks various silicates and the forms of silica itself, it was found that the first turbidity of the ammonia will, if sufficient time be allowed, commence at 120°C. At this temperature to 121°C. twenty-three minutes were requisite for the bulk of the silicium compound to come over from the retort. It was not found, however, that the action of the acid was more energetic on one silicate than on any other, or on quartz.

The several ammoniacal charges of the ammonia tube are now brought together into a platinum dish with all the washings from the test-tubes and the connecting tubes; and these are now slowly evaporated in a water-bath with continual stirring.

At a certain point of the evaporation, just before the solution becomes neutral, and the ammonium fluoride begins to become acid, all the silica in the dish is dissolved by the fluoride. The process is gradual, but the moment is easily determined when it is complete. Then the dish being removed from the water-bath, potassium chloride is added in slight excess; and absolute alcohol equal in bulk to the liquid in the platinum vessel is poured on it. Potassium fluosilicate precipitates, and after standing twenty-four hours it is filtered and washed with a mixture of equal volumes of absolute alcohol and water, and then dried and weighed. The results are accurate.

In the platinum retort are the bases, in the form of sulphates, the treatment of which calls for no further remark.

A specimen of diopside, pulverised and analysed by the method here described, yielded 53.46 per cent.; on treatment by fusion with potassium and sodium carbonate, it gave in two analyses 53.51 and 53.54 per cent. of silicic acid.
