This meteorite, which belongs to the rare class intermediate between meteoric irons or siderites and meteoric stones or aërolites (a class to which I applied some years since the term siderolites), was found in Breitenbach in Bohemia.

It is a spongy metallic mass, very similar to the siderolite of Rittersgrün in Saxony, the hollows in the iron being filled by a mixture of crystalline minerals. These minerals are two in number; and the present notice deals with these two minerals.

1\. One of them is of a pale-green colour, crystallizing in the prismatic system, and presenting at once the formula of an augitic mineral and a crystalline form nearly approximating to that of olivine. Dr. Viktor von Lang, when my colleague at the British Museum, measured some merohedral crystals of this mineral, and obtained for its elements

_a_ : _b_ : _c_ = 0.8757 : 0.8496 : 1,

110.010 = 44° 8′  
101.100 = 41° 11′  
104.100 = 74° 3′  
011.010 = 40° 16′  

The analysis of this green mineral gave, from 0.4127 grm., ---

||per cent.|Oxygent-ratios.|Equivalent ratios.  
Silica|0.2315|56.101|29.920|1.87  
Magnesia|0.1247|30.215|12.087|1.51  
Ferrous oxide|0.0560|13.583|3.018|0.37  
|0.4122|99.899||

results which correspond very nearly with an Enstatite of the formula

( Mg_subscript(4/5) Fe_subscript(1/5) ) SiO₃.

The specific gravity is 3.23.

It is remarkable that of the minerals presenting the general formula

MSiO₃,

where M stands for one or more metals of the calcium and magnesium groups, we are acquainted with two anorthic types (Rhodonite and Babingtonite); three oblique types, those, namely, of Wollastonite, of Hornblende, and of Augite; two prismatic types, those, namely, of Enstatite and Anthophyllite, homœomorphous with the oblique Augites and Hornblendes; and to these we shall have not to add (if the measurements of Dr. Lang shall prove to be distinct from those of Enstatite) a third, in the green mineral under description.

Of these, the prismatic types are essentially those of the magnesian group. The rest, with the exception of the calcium silicate (Wollastonite), are types belonging to the mixed groups.

2\. The other mineral is one of the very great interest. It is, in short, silica crystallized in forms and in a system distinct from quartz, and possibly is tridymite. In bulk it forms about a third part of the mixed crystalline mass.

The crystals are very imperfect, and are twinned: but there are two cleavages parallel to the planes of a prism of about 119°; and, on looking through a plane that is perpendicular to this zone, it is seen that the crystal is biaxial. The normal to this plane is parallel to the second mean line, the optical character being negative.

A section made for examination in the microscope showed two small crystals in which light traverses the section with equal brilliancy during its rotation between crossed Nicol prisms. This, and possibly a similar case recorded by Vom Rath, seems to result from the section being cut parallel to a composite portion of the crystal.

The analysis of the mineral gave, by distillation of the silica as silicic difluoride, and subsequent determination as potassic fluosilicate, 97.43 per cent. of silica, the remainder being oxide of iron and lime. Thus 0.3114 grm. gave:

||per cent.  
Silica|0.3034|97.43  
Ferric oxide|0.0035|1.124  
Lime|0.0018|0.578  
|0.3087|99.132

A second analysis gave 99.21 per cent. silica, 0.79 of residue.

Its specific gravity, as determined from a very small amount of the mineral picked under the microscope, was 2.18; a second determination made on a larger amount gave the value 2.245. That of tridymite is 2.295 to 2.3. This may be taken as evidence that the mineral is not quartz, the specific gravity of which is 2.65. Vom Rath's experiments were made on a rather less pure form of tridymite.

There can be no doubt from these results, further details of which shall be shortly laid before the Society, that this mineral is silica in the form of its allotropic condition and lower density. It may possibly be the mineral to which Vom Rath has given the name of Tridymite; the crystalline system, however, of Tridymite, as given by Vom Rath, does not accord with the above facts.
